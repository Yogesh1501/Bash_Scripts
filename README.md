Running a Shell Script (Bash)

1. Make the Script Executable
First, ensure your script has executable permissions. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing your script:
        cd /path/to/your/script

Then, make the script executable:
        chmod +x your-script.sh

3. Run the Script
Now you can run the script:
        ./your-script.sh
